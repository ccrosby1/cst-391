## Introduction

 - This project is an online management application designed for a gym equipment catalog. It will allow users to perform standard CRUD operations on various equipment types, with all data stored in a MySQL database. The catalog will maintain details such as equipment availability, category, pricing, and other details. The backend will be built using Node.js and Express to provide RESTful APIs for data manipulation. Two separate front-end applications, one in Angular and the other in React, will utilize these APIs.

## Conclusion

 - This project covered every layer of development, from database design and RESTful API construction to building fully functional front ends in both Angular and React. It demonstrated how different frameworks can achieve similar results using unique approaches to routing, state management, and UI rendering.

 -  Key takeaways from this iteration include:
     - Importance of clear design and consistent data formatting between front end and backend systems
     - How reusable and modular components simplify scaling and maintenance
     - Advantages of using state-driven frameworks like Angular and React for responsive, partial page updates
