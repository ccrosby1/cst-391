# Milestone 5

## Challenges During Project 

 - React Router navigation needed adjustments when moving between list, edit, and detail views

 - Ensuring form inputs correctly reflected updates and resets after submissions took tuning

 - Aligning the React front-end design with the earlier Angular aesthetic required CSS refactoring and cleanup

---

## Pending Bugs/Issues

 - Minor layout inconsistencies when the window is very wide (cards and forms occasionally stretch or misalign)

 - Some small formatting issues remain in the edit and create form margins

 - Search functionality filters by name and category but may not update immediately if API data changes before refresh

---

## Lessons Learned

 - Breaking the UI into small, reusable components made debugging and layout adjustments much more efficient

 - Properly structuring CSS variables and shared themes helps maintain consistency across multiple components and pages

 - Using React Router made navigation straightforward once the component structure was created

---

## Conclusion
 
 - This milestone focused on building the React front-end to consume the REST APIs created earlier in the backend. It teaches core skills in component design, state management, and API integration.
