## Write-up

This project taught me how to design REST APIs with Node.js, Express, and TypeScript, as well as how to connect to a MySQL database. It showed the importance of structuring the application into separate layers for routes, controllers, and DAOs. I also gained hands-on experience working with middleware and environment files to with configuration . Additionally, I practiced implementing asynchronous processing, error handling, and response routing.

## Conclusion
- This activity provided valuable hands-on experience in designing and implementing backend APIs. Key concepts covered include:
    - REST API design
    - N-layer architecture
    - Middleware security
    - Asynchronous database operations with error handling
    - Configuration through .env file
